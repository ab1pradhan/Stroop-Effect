# Stroop-Effect

In this project, I have used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. I have presented a good intuition for the data and used statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

Read the project_15.pdf file for the detailed report of the test.
